# External Power supply 

To power the RPi and Multi-EAR with an external power supply, a 5W adapter is used. One half of the adapter cable is soldered to the female amphenol connector, while the other half is soldered to the male amphenol connector. This way the external power supply of the Multi-EAR can be unplugged during storage. The amphenol connectors ensure a waterproof power supply.
