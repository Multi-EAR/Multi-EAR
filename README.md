The Mulit-EAR is an extension of the <a href="https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/14/3301/2021/amt-14-3301-2021-discussion.html">INFRA-EAR</a>, which is a multidiciplinairy sensor platform for the monitoring of geophysical parameters, and especially designed to fit a Wandering Albatros. Both platform uses various digital MEMS sensors embedded on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are small single-chip sensors that combine electrical and mechanical components and have low energy consumption. A programmable microcontroller unit, as well embedded on the PCB, controls the sensorsâ€™ sampling frequency and establishes the energy supply for the sensors and the data-communication and storage. A waterproof casing protects the platform against the weather. Because of its low power consumption, the system can be powered by a battery, solar panel, or an external power supply.

## PCB design
#### Hardware
The platform contains a PCB created to embed the MEMS sensors and facilitate the electrical circuits. The PCB carries two differential pressure sensor, a 6-axis acclerometer/gyroscope, a 6-axis accelerometer/magnetometer, a barometric pressure sensor, a temperature/humidity sensor, microphones, and has in addition a GPS for location and timing purposes, and LoRa telecomunication for data exchange. The sensors are controlled by a MSP430 microcontroller, which is integrated on the PCB.

#### Firmware
The communication between the microcontroller and MEMS sensor on the PCB is either done by Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) or Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), and depends on the sensor and personal preference. Both communication methods are bus protocols and allow for serial data transfer. However, SPI handles full-duplex communication, simultaneous communication between microcontroller and MEMS sensor, while I2C is half-duplex. Therefore, I2C has the option of clock stretching, and the communication is stopped whenever the MEMS sensor cannot send data. Besides, I2C has built-in features to verify the data communication (e.g., start/stop bit, acknowledgement of data). Although the I2C protocol is favourable, it requires more power.

The microcontroller runs on self-made software, complementing the required manufacturers electrical and communication protocols. The software allows determining the sample time, sample frequency, and data storage. The PCB includes a 64 MB flash memory, which is used to store the data. The raw output of the digital MEMS sensors are stored as bits, and the microcontroller performs no data processing to save power consumption. 

## Raspberry Pi ~ external datalogger
The data can either be stored locally on a micro-SD card on the PCB, or be transfered to a Raspeberry Pi (RPi), which functions as datalogger. The data communication is done via UART communication. The RPi recieves on a pre-specified baud-rate the data in bytes, whenafter the data can either be formatted to floats, integer, or real units before sending to the server.

## Casings
The protection of the PCB is done with a weather- and waterproof casing.
