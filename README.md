The project has been awarded the 'Digitaliserings-fonds en Ontwikkeling' research grand by the Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management and an 'Innovation' grand by the Delft University of Technology. 

The Multi-EAR is an extension of the INFRA-EAR (\cite{den2020low}), which is a multidisciplinary sensor platform for the monitoring of geophysical parameters, and specially designed to fit a Wandering Albatros. Such requirements, and thus dimensional restrictions, were not applicable by the design and development of the Multi-EAR. The project aims to develop, based on earlier recommendations, a multidisciplinary mobile sensor platform to complement the existing high-fidelity monitoring network. Due to its digital design, the sensor platform can readily be integrated with existing geophysical data infrastructures and be embedded in geophysical data analysis. The small dimensions and low-cost price per unit allow for unconventional, experimental designs, for example, high-density spatial sampling or deployment on moving measurement platforms. Moreover, such deployments can complement existing high-fidelity geophysical sensor networks. To include the Multi-EAR within existing monitoring networks, a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 8 is needed (Figure \ref{fig:8}).
