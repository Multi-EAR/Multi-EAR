# Mobile platform design
### Circuit design

The platform of the Multi-EAR uses various digital Microelectromechanical sensors (MEMS) embedded on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). A programmable microcontroller unit, embedded on the PCB, controls the sensor's sampling frequency, establishes the energy supply for the sensors, the data communication, and data storage.

The MEMS on the PCB are; two differential pressure sensor (to monitor infrasound), a 6-axis accelerometer/gyroscope, a 6-axis accelerometer/magnetometer, a barometric pressure sensor, a temperature/humidity sensor, microphones (to monitor audible sound), a GPS for location and timing purposes, and LoRa telecommunication for data exchange.
