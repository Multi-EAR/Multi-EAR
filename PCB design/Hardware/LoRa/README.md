# LoRa Telecommunication
Besides transferring data via the RPi and WiFi, the data can also be transferred by LoRa Telecommunication (\cite{LoRa}). LoRa is a type of wireless telecommunication vast area network designed to allow long-range communications at a low bit rate among things (connected objects). The low power, low bit rate and intended use distinguish this type of network from a wireless WAN designed to connect users or businesses and carry more data, using more power. The LoRa data rate ranges from 0.3 kbit/s to 50 kbit/s per channel. LoRa may be used to create a private wireless sensor network but may also be a service or infrastructure offered by a third party, allowing the owners of sensors to deploy them in the field without investing in gateway technology.
