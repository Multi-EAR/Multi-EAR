# Lab calibration

## Barometric pressure
Calibration tests on the barometric pressure sensor are performed within a pressure chamber, in which a cycle of static pressures between 930 and 1070 hPa can be produced. Besides the MEMS sensor, the chamber is equipped with a reference sensor. This procedure resulted in a calibration curve, which describes the pressure-dependent systematic bias. After correcting for the bias, the LPS sensor has an accuracy of $\pm$ 0.1 hPa, i.e., the LPS sensors measures values within $\pm$ 0.1 hPa of the value measured by the KNMI reference sensor. 

## Temperature/Humidity
The calibration tests on the temperature and humidity sensor are performed within the climate chamber. The climate chamber is a certified calibration tool, which can generate temperatures between $-30$ till $50^{\circ}$C and a humidity level (depending on the temperature) between $10-90 \pm$. Within the chamber, various reference sensors are placed. Again, the calibration results in a calibration curve, which describes the temperature/humidity dependent bias. After the bias correction, the temperature sensor has an accuracy of xxx.
